## Blocked

Tired of endlessly scrolling through YouTube Shorts?

**Blocked.** is a simple, no-nonsense solution to help you break your doomscrolling habit.

This Chrome extension blocks any instance of a YouTube Short appearing in your feed. Even if you come across a Shorts link or click one that someone sends you, Blocked automatically redirects you to the YouTube homepage.

Clean feed. Fewer distractions. More control.
